# UnityGridFramework
Open source Grid Framework for creating grid-based levels easily in Unity3D game engine

# How to use
Simply put the GridEditor.cs in your Assets/Editor folder (create one if it does not exist).

**Hint:** You can use *W* and *E* keys to rotate the selected prefab around its *Y-axis* easily (Scene View should have the focus).
**Note:** You have to save&load the settings manually, framework does not do that for you.
